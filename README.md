# react-gridifier
_Gridifier.io widget wrapped into a React component._

If you know [Gridifier](http://gridifier.io), you know its power. But it's
a JQuery library, so if you want to use it in a React application, you
certainly don't want to code any JQuery line. This wrapper is for you.

# Documentation
Coming soon...
For now, use the [Gridifier doc](http://gridifier.io) to know the main usage.
Most of the Gridifier options (settings that you can inject at construction)
can be given to this react component as properties.

# License
This wrapper is open source (MIT), but please take care of the dual license
for use of JQuery Gridifier library [here](http://gridifier.io/license).
